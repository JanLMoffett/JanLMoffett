### Hi there 👋

My name is Jan Moffett.  I came to programming through a love of Major League Baseball Analytics, and am most fluent in R for Statistics and Data Analysis, but I've also made forays into OOP/Application Development in Java, Probability Simulations, Game Design, Data Scraping, and other random stuff in Python, Web Development in CPanel and Wordpress and HTML/Javascript/CSS code.  

I earned a BS in Statistics in 2019, in addition to a BFA in Theater Design in Production I earned in 2008.  Aside from programming, I also enjoy graphic design and video production and am well-versed in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro.  

My design background combined with my knowledge of statistics makes me particularly suited to Data Visualization.  Check out my R ggplot2 examples, colors, themes, and functions.    

My goals are to learn more about Predictive Statistical Modeling and Data Science in R and Python.  And also to make little apps and games to simulate gambling, sports,  and other fun stuff.
