### Hi there 👋

My name is Jan Moffett.  I came to programming through a love of Major League Baseball Analytics.  I'm most fluent in R for Statistics and Data Analysis, but I've also made forays into OOP/Application Development in Java; Probability Simulations, Game Design, Web Scraping, and other random stuff in Python; Web Development in CPanel, Wordpress, and HTML/Javascript/CSS.  I've also written quite a few SQL scripts.  

I earned a BS in Statistics in 2019, in addition to a BFA in Theater Design in Production I earned in 2008.  Aside from programming, I also enjoy graphic design and video production and am well-versed in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro.  

My design background combined with my knowledge of statistics makes me particularly suited to Data Visualization.  Check out my R ggplot2 examples, colors, themes, and functions.    

My goals are to learn more about Predictive Statistical Modeling and Data Science in R and Python, and to learn how to develop R packages.
